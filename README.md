# Cardiovascular Disease Classifier

This repository contains the implementation of a Cardiovascular Disease Classifier based on ECG image analysis, developed as part of a major research project. The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to automatically detect various cardiovascular disorders, including abnormal heartbeat, myocardial infarction, and a history of myocardial infarction, using digitized ECG charts.

## Features

- **Advanced ECG Image Processing:** Preprocessing steps include Gaussian filtering for noise reduction, thresholding, and grayscale conversion to standardize and enhance the quality of ECG images.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression, along with an ensemble technique using a Voting-Based Classifier to improve prediction accuracy.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves an impressive accuracy of 92.5%, with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics also reflecting robust model performance.
- **Research Recognition:** Our research has been presented and published at the ICC ROBINS conference, showcasing our innovative approach to automating cardiovascular disease detection and contributing to the field of medical diagnostics.

## How It Works

The classifier processes ECG images by converting them into a standardized digital format, followed by the application of machine learning algorithms to classify the images into different cardiovascular conditions. The project demonstrates significant improvements over traditional manual methods, providing faster and more accurate diagnoses.
